# Validations I: Basics

This guide teaches you how to validate that objects are correctly
filled out before they go into the database. Validations are used to
ensure that only valid data is saved into your database. For example,
it may be important to your application to ensure that every user
provides a valid email address and mailing address. Validations keep
garbage data out.

### Validations vs. Constraints

We need to make an important distinction here. Rails *validations* are **not** the same as database *constraints*, though they are conceptually similar. Both try to ensure data integrity and consistency, but *validations* operate in your Ruby code, while *constraints* operate in the database. So the basic rule is:

* *Validations* are defined inside **models**.
* *Constraints* are defined inside **migrations**.

#### Use Constraints

We've seen how to write some database constraints in SQL (`NOT NULL`,
`FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE INDEX`). These are enforced by the database and
are very strong. Not only will they keep bugs in our Rails app from
putting bad data into the database, they'll also stop bad data coming
from other sources (SQL scripts, the database console, etc). We will
frequently use simple DB constraints like these to ensure data
consistency.

However, for complicated validations, DB constraints can be tortuous to
write in SQL. Also, when a DB constraint fails, a generic error is
thrown to Rails (`SQLException`). In general, Rails will not handle errors like these, and a web user's request will fail with an
ugly `500 Internal Server Error`.

#### Use Validations

For this reason, DB constraints are not appropriate for validating user
input. If a user chooses a previously chosen username, they should not
get a 500 error page; Rails should nicely ask for another name. This is
what *model-level validations* are good at.

Model-level validations live in the Rails world. Because we write them
in Ruby, they are very flexible, database agnostic, and convenient to
test, maintain and reuse. Rails provides built-in helpers for common
validations, making them easy to add. Many things we can validate in
the Rails layer would be very difficult to enforce at the DB layer.

#### Use Both!

Often you will use both together. For example, you might use a `NOT
NULL` constraint to guarantee good data while also taking advantage of
the user messaging provided by a corresponding `presence: true`
validation.

Perhaps a better example of this would be uniqueness. A `uniqueness:
true` validation is good for displaying useful feedback to users, but it
cannot actually guarantee uniqueness. It operates inside a single server
process and doesn't know what any other servers are doing. Two servers
could submit queries to the DB with conflicting data at the same time
and the validation would not catch it (This happens *surprisingly
often*). Because a `UNIQUE` constraint operates in the database and not
in the server, it will cause one of those requests to fail (albeit
gracelessly), preserving the integrity of your data.

## When does validation happen?

Whenever you call `save`/`save!` on a model, ActiveRecord will first
run the validations to make sure the data is valid to be persisted
permanently to the DB. If any validations fail, the object will be
marked as invalid and Active Record will not perform the `INSERT` or
`UPDATE` operation. This keeps invalid data from being inserted into
the database.

To signal success saving the object, `save` will return `true`;
otherwise `false` is returned. `save!` will instead raise an error if
the validations fail.

## `valid?`

Before saving, ActiveRecord calls the `valid?` method; this is what
actually triggers the validations to run. If any fail, `valid?`
returns `false`. Of course, when `save`/`save!` call `valid?`, they
are expecting to get `true` back. If not, ActiveRecord won't actually
perform the SQL `INSERT`/`UPDATE`.

You can also use this method on your own. `valid?` triggers your
validations and returns true if no errors were found in the object,
and false otherwise.

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
end

Person.create(name: 'John Doe').valid? # => true
Person.create(name: nil).valid? # => false
```

## `errors`

Okay, so we know an object is invalid, but what's wrong with it? We
can get a hash-like object through the`#errors` method. `#errors`
returns an instance of `ActiveModel::Errors`, but it can be used like
a `Hash`. The keys are attribute names, the values are arrays of all
the errors for each attribute. If there are no errors on the specified
attribute, an empty array is returned.

The `errors` method is only useful *after* validations have been run,
because it only inspects the errors collection and does not trigger
validations itself. You should always first run `valid?` or `save` or
some such before trying to access `errors`.

```ruby
# let's see some of the many ways a record may fail to save!

class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
end

>> p = Person.new
#=> #<Person id: nil, name: nil>
>> p.errors
#=> {}

>> p.valid?
#=> false
>> p.errors
#=> {:name=>["can't be blank"]}

>> p = Person.create
#=> #<Person id: nil, name: nil>
>> p.errors
#=> {:name=>["can't be blank"]}

>> p.save
#=> false

>> p.save!
#=> ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Name can't be blank

>> Person.create!
#=> ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Name can't be blank
```

### `errors.full_messages`

To get an array of human readable messages, call
`record.errors.full_messages`.

```
>> p = Person.create
#=> #<Person id: nil, name: nil>
>> p.errors.full_messages
#=> ["Name can't be blank"]
```

## Built-in validators

Okay, but how do we actually start telling Active Record what to
validate? Active Record offers many pre-defined validators that you
can use directly inside your class definitions. These helpers provide
common validation rules. Every time a validation fails, an error
message is added to the object's `errors` collection, and this message
is associated with the attribute being validated.

There are many many different validation helpers; we'll focus on the
most common and important. Refer to the Rails guides or documentation
for a totally comprehensive list.

### `presence`

This one is the most common by far: the `presence` helper validates
that the specified attributes are not empty. It uses the `blank?`
method to check if the value is either `nil` or a blank string, that
is, a string that is either empty or consists of only whitespace.

```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  # must have name, login, and email
  validates :name, :login, :email, presence: true
end
```

This demonstrates our first validation: we call the class method
`validates` on our model class, giving it a list of column names to
validate, then the validation type mapping to `true`.

If you want to be sure that an associated object exists, you can do
that too:

```ruby
class LineItem < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :order

  validates :order, presence: true
end
```

Don't check for the presence of the foreign_key (`order_id`); check
the presence of the associated object (`order`). This will become
useful later when we do nested forms. Until then, just develop good
habits.

The default error message is "X can't be empty".

### `uniqueness`

This helper validates that the attribute's value is unique:

```ruby
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  # no two Accounts with the same email
  validates :email, uniqueness: true
end
```

There is a very useful `:scope` option that you can use to specify
other attributes that are used to limit the uniqueness check:

```ruby
class Holiday < ApplicationRecord
  # no two Holidays with the same name for a single year
  validates :name, uniqueness: {
    scope: :year,
    message: 'should happen once per year'
  }
end
```

Notice how options for the validation can be passed as the value of
the hash.

The default error message is "X has already been taken".

### Database and Model layer validation reference

Validation    |  Database Constraint  |  Model Validation
-----------   |-----------------------|------------------
Present       |  null: false          |  presence: true
All Unique    |  add_index :tbl, :col, unique: true                   | uniqueness: true
Scoped Unique |  add_index :tbl, [:scoped_to_col, :col], unique: true | uniqueness: { scope: :scoped_to_col }

### Less common helpers

Presence and uniqueness are super-common. But there are some others
that are often handy. Refer to the documentation for all the gory
details:

* `format`
    * Tests whether a string matches a given regular expression
* `length`
    * Tests whether a string or array has an appropriate length. Has
      options for `minimum` and `maximum`.
* `numericality`; options include:
    * `greater_than`/`greater_than_or_equal_to`
    * `less_than`/`less_than_or_equal_to`
* `inclusion`
    * `in` option lets you specify an array of possible values. All
      other values are invalid.

## Warning!

Rails 5 introduces a new behavior: it automatically validates the presence of `belongs_to` associations.
To override this default behavior, we have to pass `optional: true` to the association initialization.

Let's look at an example.
Say we have the following models:

```ruby
class Home < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :cats,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :home_id,
    class_name: :Cat
end

class Cat < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :home,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :home_id,
    class_name: :Home
end
```

Let's assume that we want to allow for cats to be without a home (ðŸ˜ž).
Because Rails 5 validates the presence of `belongs_to` associations, if we try to `save` a cat without a home, we'll get a validation error.

```ruby
cat = Cat.new
cat.save!
#=> (0.3ms)  BEGIN
# (0.4ms)  ROLLBACK
# ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Home must exist
```

In order to allow for homeless cats, we would have to `optional: true` like so:

```ruby
class Cat < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :home,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :home_id,
    class_name: :Home,
    optional: true
end
```

With that, we get the following:

```ruby
cat = Cat.new
cat.save!
#=>    (0.3ms)  BEGIN
#  SQL (5.0ms)  INSERT INTO "cats" ("created_at", "updated_at") VALUES ($1, $2) RETURNING "id"  [["created_at", "2017-07-05 20:24:43.182051"], ["updated_at", "2017-07-05 20:24:43.182051"]]
#    (2.6ms)  COMMIT
```

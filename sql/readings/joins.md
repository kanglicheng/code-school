## Schema overview:

Familiarize yourself with the schema for this project:

```ruby
# db/schema.rb
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version => 20130126200858) do
  create_table "comments", force: :cascade do |t|
    # force: true drops the table before creating it.
    t.text     "body"
    t.integer  "author_id"
    t.integer  "post_id"
    t.integer  "parent_comment_id"
    t.datetime "created_at",        null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at",        null: false
  end

  create_table "posts", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string   "title"
    t.text     "body"
    t.integer  "author_id"
    t.datetime "created_at", null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
    # null: false means this field must be filled.
  end

  create_table "users", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string   "user_name"
    t.string   "first_name"
    t.string   "last_name"
    t.datetime "created_at", null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
  end
end
```

## The N+1 selects problem

Let's write some code to get the number of comments per `Post` by a
`User`:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # ...

  def n_plus_one_post_comment_counts
    posts = self.posts
    # SELECT *
    #   FROM posts
    #  WHERE posts.author_id = ?
    #
    # where `?` gets replaced with `user.id`

    post_comment_counts = {}
    posts.each do |post|
      # This query gets performed once for each post. Each db query
      # has overhead, so this is very wasteful if there are a lot of
      # `Post`s for the `User`.
      post_comment_counts[post] = post.comments.length
      # SELECT *
      #   FROM comments
      #  WHERE comments.post_id = ?
      #
      # where `?` gets replaced with `post.id`
    end

    post_comment_counts
  end
end
```

This code looks fine at the first sight. But the problem lies with the
total number of queries executed. The above code executes 1 query (to
find the user's posts) + "N" queries (one per post to find the
comments) for N+1 queries in total.

This is inefficient. Consider if a user had 10,000 posts: we'd make
10,000 queries for comments. We will next see a way to perform one
query for all the `comment`s, instead of N queries. Even though we
will receive the same number of `comments` rows total, doing all the
work in one query is much more efficient. Each query to the database
has some fixed overhead associated with it, so batching up work into
one query is a major efficiency win.

### Solution to N+1 queries problem

The solution to this problem is to fetch all the `Comment`s for all
the `Post`s in one go, rather than fetch them one-by-one for each
`Post`.

Active Record lets you specify associations to prefetch. When you use
these associations later, the data will already have been fetched and
won't need to be queried for. To do this, use the `includes`
method. If you use `includes` to prefetch data (e.g., `posts =
user.posts.includes(:comments)`), a subsequent call to access the
association (e.g., `posts[0].comments`) won't fire another DB query;
it'll use the prefetched data.

Revisiting the above case, we could rewrite `post_comment_counts` to
use eager loading:

```ruby
# app/model/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # ...

  def includes_post_comment_counts
    # `includes` *prefetches the association* `comments`, so it doesn't
    # need to be queried for later. `includes` does not change the
    # type of the object returned (in this example, `Post`s); it only
    # prefetches extra data.
    posts = self.posts.includes(:comments)
    # Makes two queries:
    # SELECT *
    #   FROM posts
    #  WHERE post.author_id = ?
    #
    # where `?` is replaced with `user.id`.
    #
    # ...and...
    #
    # SELECT *
    #   FROM comments
    #  WHERE comments.post_id IN ?
    #
    # where `?` is replaced with `self.posts.map(&:id)`, the `Array`
    # of `Post` ids.

    post_comment_counts = {}
    posts.each do |post|
      # doesn't fire a query, since already prefetched the association
      # way better than N+1
      #
      # NB: if we write `post.comments.count` ActiveRecord will try to
      # be super-smart and run a `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE
      # comments.post_id = ?` query. This is because ActiveRecord
      # understands `#count`. But we already fetched the comments and
      # don't want to go back to the DB, so we can avoid this behavior
      # by calling `Array#length`.
      post_comment_counts[post] = post.comments.length
    end

    post_comment_counts
  end
end
```

The above code will execute just **2** queries, as opposed to **N+1**
queries. When there are many posts, this is a major win.

Normally you should wait until you see performance problems before
returning to optimize code ("premature optimization is the root of all
evil"). However, N+1 queries are so egregious that you should avoid
them from the beginning. Consider N+1 queries an error; they are never
the right solution.

### Complex includes

You can eagerly load as many associations as you like:

```ruby
comments = user.comments.includes(:post, :parent_comment)
```

Then both the `post` and `parent_comment` associations are eagerly
loaded. Neither `comments[0].post` nor `comments[0].parent_comment` will
hit the DB; they've been prefetched.

We can also do "nested" prefetches:

```ruby
posts = user.posts.includes(:comments => [:author, :parent_comment])
first_post = posts[0]
```

This not only prefetches `first_post.comments`, it also will prefetch
`first_post.comments[0]` and even `first_post.comments[0].author` and
`first_post.comments[0].parent_comment`.

## Joining Tables

To perform a SQL `JOIN`, use `joins`. Like `includes`, it takes a name
of an association.

`joins` by default performs an `INNER JOIN`, so they are frequently
used to filter out records that don't have an associated record. For
instance, let's filter out `User`s who don't have `Comment`s:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # ...

  def self.users_with_comments
    # `joins` can be surprising to SQL users. When we perform a SQL
    # join, we expect to get "wider" rows (with the columns of both
    # tables). But `joins` does not automatically return a wider row;
    # User.joins(:comments) still just returns a User.
    #
    # In this sense, `joins` does the opposite of `includes`:
    # `includes` fetches the entries and the associated entries
    # both. `User.joins(:comments)` returns no `Comment` data, just
    # the `User` columns. For this reason, `joins` is used less
    # commonly than `includes`.

    User.joins(:comments).uniq
    # SELECT DISTINCT users.*
    #   FROM users
    #   JOIN comments
    #     ON comments.author_id = users.id
    #
    # Note that only the user fields are selected!
    #
    # `User.joins(:comments)` returns an array of `User` objects; each
    # `User` appears once for each `Comment` they've made. A `User`
    # without a `Comment` will not appear (`joins` uses an INNER
    # JOIN). If a user makes multiple comments, they appear multiple
    # times in the result. For this reason, we slap on a `uniq` to
    # only return a `User` at most once.
  end
end
```

### Avoiding N+1 queries without loading lots of records

We've seen how to eagerly load associated objects to dodge the N+1
queries problem. There is another problem we may run into: `includes`
returns lots of data: it returns every `Comment` on every `Post` that
the `User` has written. This may be many, many comments. In the case
of counting comments per post, the `Comment`s themselves are useless,
we just want to count them.

We're doing too much in Ruby: we want to push some of the counting
work to SQL so that the database does it, and we receive just `Post`
objects with associated comment counts. This is another major use of
`joins`:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User
  # ...

  def joins_post_comment_counts
    # We use `includes` when we need to prefetch an association and
    # use those associated records. If we only want to *aggregate* the
    # associated records somehow, `includes` is wasteful, because all
    # the associated records are pulled down into the app.
    #
    # For instance, if a `User` has posts with many, many comments, we
    # would pull down every single comment. This may be more rows than
    # our Rails app can handle. And we don't actually care about all
    # the individual rows, we just want the count of how many there
    # are.
    #
    # When we want to do an "aggregation" like summing the number of
    # records (and don't care about the individual records), we want
    # to use `joins`.

    posts_with_counts = self
      .posts
      .select("posts.*, COUNT(*) AS comments_count") # more in a sec
      .joins(:comments)
      .group("posts.id") # "comments.post_id" would be equivalent
    # in SQL:
    #   SELECT posts.*, COUNT(*) AS comments_count
    #     FROM posts
    #    JOINS comments
    #       ON comments.post_id = posts.id
    #    WHERE posts.author_id = #{self.id}
    # GROUP BY posts.id
    #
    # As we've seen before using `joins` does not change the type of
    # object returned: this returns an `Array` of `Post` objects.
    #
    # But we do want some extra data about the `Post`: how many
    # comments were left on it. We can use `select` to pick up some
    # "bonus fields" and give us access to extra data.
    #
    # Here, I would like to have the database count the comments per
    # post, and store this in a column named `comments_count`. The
    # magic is that ActiveRecord will give me access to this column by
    # dynamically adding a new method to the returned `Post` objects;
    # I can call `#comments_count`, and it will access the value of
    # this column:

    posts_with_counts.map do |post|
      # `#comments_count` will access the column we `select`ed in the
      # query.
      [post.title, post.comments_count]
    end
  end
end
```

### OUTER JOINs

The default for `joins` is to perform an `INNER JOIN`. In the previous
example we will not return any posts with zero comments because there
will be no comment row to join the post against.

If we want to include posts with zero comments, we need to do an outer
join. We can do this like so:

```ruby
posts_with_counts = self
  .posts
  .select('posts.*, COUNT(comments.id) AS comments_count') # more in a sec
  .joins('LEFT OUTER JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id')
  .group('posts.id') # "comments.post_id" would be equivalent
```

This is a little more verbose because we don't get the benefit of
piggybacking on the association name. We have to specify the primary
and foreign key columns for the join.

### Specifying `where` conditions on joined tables

You can specify conditions on the joined tables as usual, but you
should qualify the column names:

```ruby
# fetch comments on `Posts` posted in the previous day
start_time = (DateTime.now.midnight - 1.day)
end_time = DateTime.now.midnight
Comment.joins(:post).where(
  'posts.created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?',
  start_time,
  end_time
).uniq
```

This is because of the potential that both tables have columns with
the same name.

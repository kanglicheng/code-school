# During The Project

Follow the instructions in this document once the project has started. Make sure that you have completed everything in the [proposal instructions][proposal] first.

### Design Documents

We want to make sure that our design docs are up to date with our app's implementation. This allows us to reference them later without digging through code and will help us better plan future features. Whenever your implementation strays from the design you laid out, make sure to update your docs to reflect those changes. If you're making major changes, feel free to run them by your PA to make sure you're on the right track.

### Creating Issues

You will complete this phase for each MVP directly before coding it. Please do not complete all of the issues for all milestones for your proposal at once. This will be your final chance to think about your planning for this component before you start coding it.

We'll start with only one issue for our milestone. There will be more to add later, don't worry.

1. Create an issue called `PA Review: {MVP}` (Project Advisor Review). If you are working on user authentication, the issue would be called `PA Review: User Authentication`.

![Create Github issue][create_issues]

2. In the description of this issue, create a checklist in markdown containing each of the below, if it pertains to this MVP.

+ Backend: DB, model, controller, views
+ Redux Loop: ajax, actions, reducer
+ Presentational Components
+ Styling
+ Smooth, bug-free navigation
+ Adequate and appropriate seeds

![Make checklist][checklist]

3. Attach the label `core feature` to the issue

4. Lastly, set the issue to be part of our milestone.

### Using PA Review Issues

The PA Review issue is how your PA will track your progress and give you feedback.

From the 'Issues' tab, you can view all open issues.

![Issues overview][issues_overview]

1. As you create your app, you will write enough code to satisfy an item on the checklist. Make sure that you have tested that part of your code thoroughly! Once you have thoroughly tested, check off that list item in your `PA Review` issue.

2. Once all of your list items are complete, _assign_ this issue to your project advisor. Upon assigning them, they will receive a notification and know to review your work (both the code and Heroku!).

![Assign issue][pm_review_issue]

3. Your PA will review your code and Heroku site.
  + If they are satisfied, your PA will close the issue and this MVP is considered complete.
  + Alternatively, if there are any additional changes to be made, your PA will leave a comment with checklists describing the needed changes in a list. At which point, you should:
  
    1. Make the changes for each list item and check it off
    2. When all are complete, leave a new comment on the `PA Review` issue with your PA's Github username. This will email them so they know to review it.

![PA Feedback][pm_feedback]

There may be some time between finishing the checklist and getting feedback from your PA (like over the weekend). If this happens, start work on your next MVP while you wait. When you do get feedback, you need to go back and complete those before continuing on with your new MVP. The changes you need to make may affect the new MVP so it will be best to complete them ASAP.

### Using Other Issues

Since we have already set up milestones, feel free to add any issues you want to help you track tasks or problems you encounter in your app. If these issues are assigned to milestones, the mileston view will give a great view your progress at a high level.

![50% completed milestone][milestones_overview]

As long as an issue is not a `PA Review` issue, feel free to close it yourself! You can include a [special command like `resolves`][git_keywords] in your git commit message telling GitHub to automatically close the issue. Simply include the keyword and the number of the issue that you are closing, and GitHub does the rest when you push to master!

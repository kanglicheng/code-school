# React-Lite

This project is simple re-creation of React.js. It will feature the
following:
- A virtual DOM
- Lifecycle implementation
- Reconciliation following React heuristics

Step 1
- `Element` - `#createElement` POJO creator
  - `type`
  - `children`
  - `props`

Step 2
- Render an `Element`
  - `RLDOM#render` method
- Recursively render children

Step 3
- Unmount an `Element` from DOM
  - this will be a helper method when we update components
- Recursively unmount children first, then self

Step 4
- `#_diff` between two element trees
  - compare roots
    - if different, unmount prev, mount next
    - if same
      - compare the children
      - try to salvage children with same key

Step 4
- Component
  - create `Component` class to extend
  - include lifecycle methods

Step 5
- Handle Components in `_mount`, `_unmount`, `_diff`
  - with lifecycle methods

Step 6
- create `setState` method

Step 7
- #TODO: add event handlers
